# microbit-challenges
Tutorial sheets and challenges for the python programming language.

These tutorial sheets are designed to give students an introduction to the features of the
Micro:bit.  Short practical examples are provided and students are invited to design solutions to problems
using the fundamental building blocks presented. The tutorial sheets are also useful in a classroom setting when students are offline.
The challenges can be used for team competitions or just for fun!


Learning to code by using a microprocessor and embedded sensors 
on the board, was inspired by Prof. Stephen Hailes at UCL. (His team also designed the Engduino <http://www.engduino.org>).
Steve created the teaching material for the 
Engduino and some of that content is reused here.
Likewise, in some places, the content is an abridged version of the
BBC Micro:bit MicroPython documentation <http://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io>.


If you would like to contribute, go ahead! Install git and create a branch. It would be great to have more challenges and some projects.

The documentation is built with sphinx-docs, http://www.sphinx-doc.org/. You only need to install sphinx-docs
if you want to generate a copy of the documentation locally. Follow instructions on the sphinx-docs website
 for information about how to install sphinx-docs. If you want to generate pdf documents locally then you must also install latex.

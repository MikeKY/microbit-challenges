BBC Micro:bit Worksheets
========================



.. note::

	These worksheets and challenges are, in places,  an abridged version of the BBC Micro:bit Python 
	documentation at http://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io. As 
	such, some of the content has been copied directly from that source. This 
	format is useful in a classroom scenario where students might be offline, using a printed copy of 
	these worksheets. The Challenge sheets can be used for team competitions or just for fun!

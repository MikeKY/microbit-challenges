BBC Micro:bit Worksheets
========================

	These tutorial sheets are designed to give students an introduction to the features of the 
	Micro:bit.  Short practical examples are provided and students are invited to design solutions to problems 
	using the fundamental building blocks presented. This learning approach was developed by 
	Prof. Stephen Hailes at UCL in designing the teaching material for the `Engduino <http://www.engduino.org>`_ 
	and has been reused here. The design of the Micro:bit was strongly inflienced by the 
	Engduino and some of the content is taken directly from the Engduino tutorial sheets.  
	Likewise, in some places, the content is an abridged version of the 
	`BBC Micro:bit MicroPython documentation <http://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io>`_.  

	The tutorial sheets are also useful in a classroom setting when students are offline. 
	The Challenge sheets can be used for team competitions or just for fun!

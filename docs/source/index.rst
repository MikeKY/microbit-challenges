BBC Micro:bit Worksheets
========================

	These tutorial sheets are designed to give students an introduction to the features of the 
	Micro:bit.  The format is also useful in the classroom when students are offline. 
	Short practical examples are provided and students are invited to design solutions to problems 
	using the fundamental building blocks presented. This learning approach was initially adopted by 
	Prof. Stephen Hailes at UCL in designing the teaching material for the Engduino <www.engduino.org> 
	and has been reused here. The design of the Micro:bit was strongly inflienced by the design of the 
	Engduino and some of the content is taken directly from the Engduino tutorial sheets.
 
	Likewise, in some places, the content of the worksheets and challenges is an abridged version of the 
	BBC Micro:bit MicroPython documentation at <http://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io>.  Some of 
	the content has been copied directly from that source. 

	The Challenge sheets can be used for team competitions or just for fun!
